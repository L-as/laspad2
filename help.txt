Syntax: laspad <command> [arguments...]
This is a tool for NS2 to publish and create workshop mods.

Your source should be in the `src` folder.
Your dependencies will be stored in `dependencies`.

A file called `config.toml` will be created, which will contain
your configuration.

Each table entry in the file will represent a separate workshop
contribution.
This way you can easily manage beta versions of mods.

To create a new variation, just make a new entry in the configuration
file.

The mod ids (hex version of workshop ids) will be stored in text
files as hex strings named as such: `.modid.<variation>`.

Commands:
 * init
   Initialises a new mod in the current directory.

 * publish [variation]
   Publishes the mod as the specified steam workshop contribution.

 * compile
   Compiles all dependencies and your own mod into the `compiled` folder
   for you to use as the game path in NS2.
   You don't need to use this, if you don't have any dependencies.

   On posix, the files will be hard-linked, so you only need to run
   this if you add or remove a file.

 * necessitate   <git repo URLs>
   Adds the git repos as dependencies (actually submodules).
   They will be included when you compile or publish.

 * unnecessitate <git repo names>
   Removes the git repos as dependencies.

 * update
   Makes sure that all dependencies are completely initialised and updated.
